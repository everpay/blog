Balanced is a payments company that enables entrepreneurs and developers to
create new and amazing e-commerce experiences. We’ve built a white-labeled API
and web-based dashboard to help them do this. Specifically, we offer two
products: Balanced Payouts and Balanced Processing, which can be coupled. We
really like working with marketplaces and crowdfunding platforms, but Balanced
can be used for any type of e-commerce model. You should use Balanced to
charge your buyers’ credit cards and/or pay out to your sellers’ US-based bank
accounts via **[ACH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Clearing_House)**.
