[redditgifts](redditgifts.com) just [set a record in 2012](http://redditgifts.com/blog/view/reddit-now-holds-guinness-worlds-record/) with the world's biggest Secret Santa gift exchange and they're already planning to have an even bigger 2013. Today redditgifts is announcing six new exchanges for:

- books
- snacks
- coffee/tea
- Pokemon
- socks
- hats/scarves

redditgifts is also inviting merchants that sell items in any of these categories to list their items directly on the [redditgifts Marketplace](redditgifts.com/marketplace/), which is powered by Balanced. Merchants interested in having their items listed on the redditgifts Marketplace should fill-out [this application](http://redditgifts.com/marketplace/merchant/apply/). 

redditgifts is an inherently social ecommerce experience; something that can't exist on Amazon for example. It's fun to watch what one of the biggest online communities in the world can do with ecommerce. Balanced happy to be along for the ride.
