I was negotiating with one of our banking partners a few months ago for
a discount
based on the increase in our transaction volume. I also asked for pricing
tiers, so that
I would know what the pricing would look like in the future as our
we continue to grow.
The bank responded with something on the lines of, "We don't do that,
but we can revisit the pricing later."

How was I supposed to plan if I don't know what the price will be in the
future?
Why did I even have to spend so much time negotiating? Why not just give me the
pricing formula? I didn't understand why it
was so complicated. Then something (my co-founder, Jareau) hit me. We do the
exact same thing.

We've had a standard pricing formula internally for some time now, but we
hadn't published it for everyone to see. There wasn't any reason why. We
followed the same formula for everyone.

Without further ado, here it is ...

<table style="width:500px;">
    <tr style="font-weight:bold;">
        <td>
            Card Processing Volume Per Month
        </td>
        <td>
            Transaction Rate
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Below $100k
        </td>
        <td>
            2.9% + 30¢
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            $100k -- $500k
        </td>
        <td>
            2.7% + 30¢
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            $500k -- $1MM
        </td>
        <td>
            2.4% + 30¢
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            $1MM -- $5MM
        </td>
        <td>
            2.2% + 30¢
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Over $5MM
        </td>
        <td>
            1.9% + 30¢
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
