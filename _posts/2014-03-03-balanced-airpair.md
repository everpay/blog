## It's OK to Ask for Help

We're happy to announce that we're teaming up with [AirPair](http://www.airpair.com/), a platform for live programming assistance, to give the Balanced community a new way to connect with one another while implementing checkout, escrow and payouts in their apps. Use AirPair to connect with [Balanced Experts](http://www.airpair.com/balanced-payments) via video chat and screen sharing when you run into an issue you can't solve. These experts have extensive experince with our API and can be reserved for an hourly fee via AirPair.

You can read the full details about our collaboration with AirPair on their [Trusted Partner Experts Page](http://www.airpair.com/news/2014-02/airpair-trusted-partner-experts).

Hope this helps,
