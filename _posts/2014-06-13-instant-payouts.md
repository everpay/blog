We released our [Push to Card](https://www.balancedpayments.com/push-to-card)
API a few weeks ago to allow marketplaces to send money to a customerâ€™s checking
account using a debit card number. Starting today, Balanced now supports
instant payouts to 50% of bank accounts in the U.S. using the same API and debit
card number. We're working on bringing instant payouts to over 70% of debit card
users in the U.S. in the coming weeks.

### What does "instant" mean?

The money will be available in a customer's bank account within seconds. By
available, I mean the customer will see an increase in their Available Balance
and be able to spend the money within seconds of the payout. The payout is
instant even during evenings, weekends, and holidays.

### How does Balanced make instant transfers?

We currently partner with the ATM networks NYCE, Pulse, STAR, and SHAZAM. Those
networks allow us to move money instantly to bank accounts at 4,500
banks&mdash;including TD Bank, PNC Bank, Capital One, Fifth Third, RBS Citizens,
and Comerica. We're working hard to partner with more networks to improve our
coverage.

### Why does instant matter?

There's a delay from when a marketplace issues a payout to when the money shows up
in a customer's bank account. We affectionately refer to the period during the delay
as "the black hole of payments". It's the stressful period where a marketplace
and their customer is left wondering, "Where's my money!?" We've tried to reduce
the size of the black hole and provide more transparency into it, but we want to
eliminate the black hole altogether. We're now 50% of the way there.

### Why else does this matter?

We've seen marketplaces where more than half of the sellers on the marketplace
are also buyers on the same marketplace. If you sell a handbag, you may want to
use that same money to buy a dress. Paying a customer using their debit card
means the customer can use the same debit card on file to make a purchase.

We fell in love with marketplaces because we believe marketplaces enable new
commerce, and we want to eliminate the awkwardness and friction in payments.
Instant payouts takes us one step closer to that goal.
